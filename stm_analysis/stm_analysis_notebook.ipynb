The raw data can take the form of a topography scan (*.Z_flat* file), a spectroscopy scan (*.I(V)_flat* file) and a current-distance scan (*.I(Z)_flat* file) - all of which are displayed and analysed within this Jupyter notebook.\n",

More importantly, this will then allow you to use Vernissage as a data reduction tool, such that all the *good* and *sensible* data can be imported into this Jupyter notebook for viewing and subsequent analysis.\n",

This allows you to do two things; (i) any anomalous data or maxed out data can be rejected, or (ii) the voltage bias domain can be restricted so that the maximum tunneling current is identical in the +/- bias regimes. Any $I(V)$ data that is cropped out is displayed as grey points in the corresponding 'Raw $I(V)$'figures.* \n",

Bad quality $dI/dV$ curves are ones that look like an 'M', which has minima that are much lower than that of the band-gap itself. In order to rectify this issue with bad data, it is recommended to cut the domain of the $I(V)$ curves (using the *Restrict V* slider), such that these spurious regions are deleted from the edges.

This gives a direct illustration of how the $dI/dV$ curves change over the different $I(V)$ curves selected, in the form of a CITS slice. Additionally, the VBM and CBM edges are displayed from the previous band-gap calculations performed in the 'Point STS' analysis and given you have a sufficient amount of $I(V)$ curves (~50+), the band-gap can be checked for consistency from the image.\n",

Hence, this allows you to get good estimates of the band-gap, given that you have obtained a sufficient (~50+) amount of repeats, but to also identify any surface states that exist when $I(V)$ curves are taken alone a pristine-defect-pristine line.\n",
